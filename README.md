# PyQt5 Application for Thrust Bench

This repository contains a desktop application built using Python and the PyQt5 framework, designed to facilitate thrust benchmarking. The application provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for running, monitoring, and visualizing thrust bench tests, making it accessible for both engineers and researchers working on propulsion systems.

## Features

- **User-Friendly GUI:** Easily configure and launch thrust bench experiments through interactive windows and dialogs.
- **Real-Time Data Monitoring:** Observe sensor outputs and system metrics as tests progress.
- **Data Visualization:** View charts and graphs of thrust measurements and other relevant metrics.
- **Logging & Export:** Automatically log all test data with options to export results in various formats for further analysis.
- **Customizable Settings:** Adapt the application to different hardware setups and test requirements.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error management and notifications to ensure smooth operation during experiments.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- PyQt5 for GUI
- Additional libraries for data handling and visualization (e.g., matplotlib, numpy)

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and follow the instructions in the README to install dependencies and launch the application.
